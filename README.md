# *nba_py - [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com) API for python*

## Summary
A python facing API for stats.nba.com (Still in heavy development)

Originally based off <https://github.com/bradleyfay/NBAStats>



## Installation
    $ pip install nba_py

## Requirements [![Requires.io](https://img.shields.io/requires/github/seemethere/nba_py.svg?style=flat-square)](https://requires.io/github/seemethere/nba_py/requirements/?branch=master)
  * [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

## Nice to have
Pandas is nice to have because it'll put the data in an easy to manage object, but it is by no means necessary. All data, if pandas is not installed is returned in a nice json list format with headers!
  * [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) [(Installation Help)](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/wiki/Installing-pandas)


## Completed work
  * See the [wiki](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/wiki/Completed-Work-Log)

## Planned development
#### 1. Documentation
  * All around documentation not only of nba_py but also stats.nba.com (it's pretty nonexistent)

#### ~~2. Map rest of API~~ (Completed)
