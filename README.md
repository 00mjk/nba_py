## Requirements [![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/seemethere/nba_py/requirements.svg?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/seemethere/nba_py/requirements/?branch=master)
  * [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

## Nice to have
Pandas is nice to have because it'll put the data in an easy to manage object, but it is by no means necessary. All data, if pandas is not installed is returned in a nice json list format with headers!

## Completed work

## Planned development
#### 1. Documentation

#### ~~2. Map rest of API~~ (Completed)
